File structure:
    - mobile
        - Codebase for the mobile application, which should be built using the PhoneGap Build system, at http://build.phonegap.com/. The folder need only to be zipped up before upload.
    - rest
        - Codebase for the RESTful API.
    - web
        - Codebase for the human-web web application.
    - Asthma.apk
        - The built mobile app, that interfaces with 'http://andrewedwards.co.uk/asthma-final/rest/web', an instance of the submitted version of the RESTful API.
    - README.txt
        - This file

This project can be set-up from the zip file by performing the following actions:
    1. Upload the 'web' and 'rest' folders to an apache server with:
        * The 'mod_rewrite' module enabled.
        * PHP version 7 or greater
        * PHP extension 'pdo_mysql' enabled.
    2. Start a MySQL server instance and create a table within that instance
    3. Configure the two 'db.php' files at 'web/config/db.php' and 'rest/config/db.php', replacing the existing host and dbname values.
    4. Alter the "base_url" variable in 'mobile/js/main.js' to the url of the apache server, with '/rest/web/' added to the end.
    5. Compress the mobile folder into a zip file, and upload it to http://build.phonegap.com/. This might require the creation of an Adobe account.
    6. Download the resulting APK file, and install it to an Android device.

The project should now function correctly.

In order to create a user account, you should register on the login page of the web application.
An email will not be sent, but a mail file will be created in 'web/runtime/mail' that will contain a confirmation link.
It is recommended that you either create a user account with the username 'Andy' to use as an admin account, or alter the 'admins' attribute in 'web/config/web.php'.

A pre-compiled APK is included within the zip file, which is set-up to interact with the API at 'andrewedwards.co.uk/asthma-final/rest/web',
which is an instance of the submitted version of the web application and API.

A user account has been registered on this instance, accessible with the username 'mmp' and the password 'mmpmmp'
